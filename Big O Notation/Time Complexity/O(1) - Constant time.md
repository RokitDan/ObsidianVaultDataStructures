- The fastest an algorithm can operate
- An algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of the amount of data

O(1) represents constant time complexity in Big O notation. It means the execution time remains the same regardless of input
size.

For example, accessing an element in an array by its index is O(1) - it takes the same amount of time whether the array has 10
elements or 10 million elements.

**Other O(1) examples include:**

- Looking up a value in a hash table by key
- Adding or removing an element at the end of an array
- Checking if a number is even or odd

The "1" indicates that the operation completes in constant time, independent of input size.
