Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm as a
function of the input size. It measures how the execution time grows with the
input size.

1. [[O(1) - Constant time]]
2. [[O(log n) - Logarithmic time]]
3. [[O(n) - Linear time]]
4. [[O(n log n) - Linearithmic time]]
5. [[O(n²) - Quadratic time]]
6. [[O(2ⁿ) - Exponential time]]
