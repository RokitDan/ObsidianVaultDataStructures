- Measures speed and efficiency in programming
- Evaluates how data structurers are performing
- Different Data structures are optimized for different scenarios
- Data structures are measured in time complexity

Big O notation is a mathematical way to describe the efficiency or complexity of an algorithm, specifically how its runtime or space requirements grow as the input
size increases.

It describes the upper bound (worst-case scenario) of an algorithm's time or space complexity. The notation uses "O" followed by a mathematical expression showing
how the algorithm scales.

### Key aspects:

• Focuses on the dominant term as input size approaches infinity
• Ignores constants and lower-order terms
• Provides worst-case analysis (most common use case)
• Helps compare algorithms' efficiency

*Common Big O complexities from fastest to slowest:

1. [[O(1) - Constant time]]
2. [[O(log n) - Logarithmic time]]
3. [[O(n) - Linear time]]
4. [[O(n log n) - Linearithmic time]]
5. [[O(n²) - Quadratic time]]
6. [[O(2ⁿ) - Exponential time]]

Big O analysis helps developers make informed decisions about which algorithms to use based on expected input sizes and performance requirements.
