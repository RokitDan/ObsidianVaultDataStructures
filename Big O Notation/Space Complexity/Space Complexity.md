Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm
as a function of the input size. It measures how much additional memory is
used during execution.

*It's expressed using Big O notation, just like time complexity.*

**Here are the common Big O notations relevant to space complexity:**
- [[O(1) - Constant Space]]
- [[O(n) - Linear Space]]
- [[O(n²) - Quadratic Space]]
- [[O(log n) - Logarithmic Space]]
- [[O(n log n) - Linearithmic Space]]
- [[O(2ⁿ) - Exponential Space]]

These notations help analyze how memory requirements scale with problem size.

**Key aspects:**
• [[Auxiliary space]] - Extra space used by the algorithm
• [[Input space]] - Space required to store input data
• [[Total space]] - Sum of auxiliary and input space

**Common examples:**
• [[Array]] of size n: O(n) space complexity
• 2D matrix n×n: O(n²) space complexity
•[[Linked list]] of size n: [[O(n) - Linear Space]]
• Recursion stack: [[O(h)]] where h is recursion depth

**Space complexity matters for:**
• Memory usage optimization
• Handling large datasets
• Understanding resource requirements
• Designing efficient algorithms
