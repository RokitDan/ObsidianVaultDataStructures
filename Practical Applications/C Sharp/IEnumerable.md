is an interface in C# that represents a sequence of elements that
can be enumerated. It's the base interface for all collections that
support iteration, including [[array]]s, lists, and other collection
types.

The IEnumerable interface defines a single method:

â€¢ GetEnumerator() - Returns an enumerator that iterates through the
collection

This feature is not exclusive to C#, but it's most prominent in C#.
Other languages have similar concepts:

1. Java - Uses Iterable interface
2. Python - Uses __iter__ method and iterators
3. JavaScript - Uses Symbol.iterator
4. Go - Uses channels and range operations

In C#, IEnumerable is fundamental to [[LINQ]] operations, as it enables
the Select, Where, and other LINQ methods to work with any
collection that implements this interface.

The interface is part of the System.Collections namespace and is
implemented by most built-in collection types like arrays, List,
Dictionary<TKey, TValue>, etc.

The key benefit of IEnumerable is that it provides a standardized
way to iterate over collections without requiring knowledge of the
specific collection type's internal structure.
