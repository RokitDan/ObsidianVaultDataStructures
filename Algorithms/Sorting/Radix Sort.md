I can explain radix sort to you. Radix sort is a non-comparative
integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing
individual digits.

Key characteristics:

• It processes digits from least significant to most significant
(or vice versa)
• Time complexity is O(d × n) where d is the number of digits and n
is the number of elements
• Space complexity is O(n + k) where k is the range of digits (0-9
for decimal)
• It's stable, meaning equal elements maintain their relative order
• It works best when the range of possible values is not
significantly greater than the number of elements

The algorithm typically uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort
by each digit position.
