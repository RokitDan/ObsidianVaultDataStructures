A Hash Set is a specific implementation of the [[Set]] data structure that uses a hash table as its underlying storage mechanism.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Uses hash function to compute indices for elements
- Provides [[O(1) - Constant time]] average time complexity for basic operations
- Elements are stored with no particular order (unlike TreeSet which maintains sorted order)
- Handles collisions through techniques like chaining or open addressing

**How it works:**
1. When an element is added, it's hashed to compute a table index
2. If the slot is empty, the element is stored there
3. If a collision occurs, it's handled using chaining (linked lists) or open addressing

**Common Implementations:**
- C++: std::unordered_set<int>
- Java: HashSet<Integer>
- JavaScript: Set (though JavaScript's Set is not strictly a hash set)
- Python: set built-in (uses hash table internally)

Hash Sets are ideal when you need fast operations and don't require elements to be ordered.
